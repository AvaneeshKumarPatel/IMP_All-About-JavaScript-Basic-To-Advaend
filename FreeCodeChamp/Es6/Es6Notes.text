ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification,
 the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5,
 JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, 
you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.

                    Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters

In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, 
you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
The console would display the strings You have passed 3 arguments. and You have passed 4 arguments..

The rest parameter eliminates the need to use the arguments object and allows us to use array methods on the array of parameters passed to the function howMany.

                                                                Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place

ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. 
The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place,
 like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. For example:

const spreaded = [...arr];
However, the following code will not work:

const spreaded = ...arr;

                           Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;
Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

                               Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects

Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on.
 The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.

                           Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects
                          
You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:

const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user
