                  Find the Length of a String

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

                   Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

       In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code will produce an error because the letter B in the string Bob cannot be changed to the letter J:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
Note that this does not mean that myStr could not be re-assigned. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new value, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

              Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

        Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Example:

const firstName = "Augusta";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

                                 Word Blanks
You are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

Consider this sentence:

It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____.
This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";

In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.
