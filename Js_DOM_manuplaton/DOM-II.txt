Reacting to Events

A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

Examples of Events:

When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key
