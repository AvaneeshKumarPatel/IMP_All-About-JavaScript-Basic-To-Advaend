Browser Event =>>

Reacting to Events

A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

Examples of Events:

When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key


Note:-  all Events are invisiable  by defeault , if you want to make it visible you can do from this method => moniterEvents(doucument); 
                                                                                                         off this => UnmonitorEvent(doucument)

   function print (){
    conetnt.style.background = 'green';
  console.log('Clicked');
};
conetnt.addEventListener('click', print);

conetnt.removeEventListener('click',print);
